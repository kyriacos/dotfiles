- Fix the f**ing error i keep getting in vim when i open up a file or the first time i load command-t
- Break the vim files out to their own config
- Use NeoBundle instead to manage plugins
- Use ctrl-p?
- Write a better Rakefile ;). Use tasks.
- Add github pages for the vim files

- Look into using bash\_it for bash, since i don't care for bash anyway?
- Make a sane bash config
- Make a saner ZSH config? (shared? with bash)
