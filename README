temporary set up for now. Browse through them. I might change some things as i go along. Check back in a week when everything is running smoothly and the README is updated too :).

I still haven't really decided if i'm going to symlink all the files or just the whole dotfile directory.

the dotfiles i have are just a collection of other dotfiles i found from people around the web.


clone the directory and have a look:
git clone git@github.com:kyriacos/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles


TODO:
- update README
- updated symlink path
- add install script
- update path to $DOTFILES

NOTES:
- brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
- brew install zsh-completion
- brew install bash-completion
